- 👋 Hi, I’m @CMC06
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering and web development. I'm hoping to build interesting web apps that help improve our world.
- 🌱 I currently use JavaScript for full stack development (Next, React, Node, and Express mostly), I'm also planning to pick up an object oriented language (likely either C# or Java) soon! :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any JS projects, especially if they have the goal of helping people or the environment.
